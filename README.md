#Project Description for my GitHub Project: Tomato Disease Detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
 
Hello everyone,
 
I am thrilled to introduce you to my GitHub project, centered around the detection and classification of tomato diseases utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
 
#Project Objective:
My primary aim with this project is to create a system capable of identifying 9 distinct tomato diseases and distinguishing healthy tomatoes. This will be achieved by analyzing images of tomato leaves using the potent capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks. This technology promises accurate and dependable classifications.
 
#Dataset:
In order to realize this objective, I have harnessed a comprehensive dataset containing an impressive collection of 11,000 tomato leaf images. This dataset has been sourced from the Kaggle database and can be conveniently accessed through this [link:] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhb999/tomatoleaf) 

 
To heighten the precision of my models, I've divided the dataset into training and validation subsets. Each subfolder within these subsets is dedicated to images belonging to a specific category of tomato leaves. This division facilitates improved model adaptation and evaluation.
 
#Requirements:
For those interested in executing this project on their personal systems, there are a few prerequisites that need to be met:
 
Installation of Anaconda: Anaconda Download.
Installation of the following Python libraries (if not already present):
tensorflow
keras
jupyter
matplotlib
numpy
These libraries can be conveniently installed through the graphical user interface of Anaconda or via the Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda3) by utilizing the command conda install [package_name].
 
#Let's Get Started:
Once the requirements are met, you're all set to delve into the project on your own systems. I've taken care to thoroughly document the code, ensuring an easy entry point for you. Should you encounter queries or challenges, don't hesitate to create issues or get in touch with me directly.
 
I'm optimistic that this project will serve as a valuable educational resource for those with an interest in image recognition, machine learning, and agriculture. I eagerly welcome your contributions and feedback to further enhance the project.
 
Wishing you an enjoyable journey of exploration and experimentation!
